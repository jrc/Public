## FAQ

### Why the "plus"?

When I was at [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/), the email system did fuzzy [common name matching](https://web.archive.org/web/20000914184801/http://www.cmu.edu/computing/documentation/unix/cmuedu.html) by default, so you could write a full name e.g. `harry.bovik@andrew.cmu.edu` and it would try to deliver it to the right mailbox. If you added a plus sign (`+`), the system would do an exact match instead of a fuzzy match, i.e. the `+` character makes it unambiguous. So in practice, I went by `jrc+`, and it stuck.
