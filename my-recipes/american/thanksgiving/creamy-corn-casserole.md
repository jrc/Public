This is the BEST Creamy Corn Casserole! It&#039;s fluffy, creamy, and is the star of holiday meals! Only 5 minutes and 7 ingredients (including Jiffy Mix) required.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup unsalted butter (melted (1/2 cup = 1 stick))
* 1 (8 oz) container Sour cream (room temperature)
* 2 large eggs (room temperature )
* 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
* 1 (15 oz) can creamed corn
* 1 (15 oz) can sweet corn (drained)
* 1 (8.5) oz box Jiffy corn muffin mix
* 1/2 teaspoon salt (more or less to taste)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and grease a glass 9x13 inch baking pan with cooking spray. Set aside.
1. In a large bowl, whisk together butter, sour cream, and eggs until well combined.
1. Stir in sugar, cream style corn, sweet corn, corn muffin mix, and salt.
1. Pour mixture into the prepared pan.
1. Bake in preheated oven for 20-35 mins or until the mixture has set. It may still be slightly &quot;jiggly&quot;, but that&#x27;s ok!
