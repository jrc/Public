- 2 tablespoons finely minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons finely grated fresh ginger
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 2 teaspoons ground paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon ground garam masala
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)
- 1 tablespoon salt

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

### For the Chicken:

- 4-6 chicken thighs or drumsticks (bone-in, skinless)
- 2-3 chicken breasts (skinless, boneless)
- butter for basting

## Instructions

**Marinate:**

- Mix all marinade ingredients in a large bowl.
- Make deep cuts in the chicken thighs and drumsticks. Butterfly or pound the chicken breasts.
- Add all chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well-coated. Cover and refrigerate. Marinate thighs and drumsticks for at least 4 hours (preferably overnight), and breasts for 1-4 hours.

**Prepare Grill:**

- Light charcoal, push coals to one side for two-zone cooking. Preheat grill and oil the grate.

**Grill Chicken:**

- Thighs and Drumsticks: Sear over direct heat for 2-3 minutes per side, then move to indirect heat. Cook for 20-30 minutes until internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Baste occasionally with butter or ghee.
- Chicken Breasts: Sear over direct heat for 2-3 minutes per side, then move to indirect heat. Cook for 10-15 minutes until internal temperature reaches 160°F (71°C). Baste frequently with butter or ghee.

**Rest and Serve:**

- Let all chicken pieces rest for 5-10 minutes. The internal temperature of the breasts will rise to 165°F (74°C) during this time.
- Serve hot, garnished with fresh cilantro and lemon wedges.
