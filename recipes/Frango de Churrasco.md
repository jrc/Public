## Ingredients

- 1 whole chicken (about 1.5 kg), butterflied

- 1–2 tsp salt

Marinade:

- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 10 ml paprika (preferably smoked)
- 1/2 tsp chili flakes (or 1 dried piri-piri pepper, finely chopped)
- 10 ml piri-piri sauce
- 100 ml olive oil
- 30 ml lemon juice (or white wine vinegar)
- 1 tsp dried oregano

## Instructions

1. Prepare the Chicken:

   - Butterfly the chicken by removing the backbone and flattening it.
   - Use a fork to pierce the chicken all over, focusing on the thicker parts of both the white and dark meat.
   - Sprinkle salt generously over the entire chicken. Use about 1-2 teaspoons of salt for a whole chicken. Let it sit for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

1. Prepare the Marinade:

   - In a small bowl, combine the marinade ingredients. Marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for 2-4 hours (white meat) / up to 12 hours or overnight (dark meat).
   - Remove the chicken from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before cooking to allow it to come to room temperature.

1. Prepare the Grill:

   - Set up your grill for two-zone cooking.

1. Grill the Chicken:

   - Remove the chicken from the marinade and let any excess marinade drip off.
   - Place the chicken skin-side down on the high heat side of the grill. Grill for about 5-7 minutes until the skin is crispy and has nice grill marks.
   - After searing, move the chicken to the medium heat side of the grill. Grill for another 20-30 minutes, turning occasionally and basting with the marinade.
   - Use a meat thermometer to ensure the internal temperature reaches 75°C (165°F).

1. Rest and Serve:

   - Once the chicken is cooked through, remove it from the grill and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before carving.
