This warming and comforting sundubu jjigae is made with thinly sliced meat and kimchi. It takes less than 30 minutes to prepare this bubbling pot of stew packed with robust flavors!

## Ingredients

- 1 package (12 ounces) sundubu (extra soft/silken tofu)
- 0.333 cup thinly sliced kimchi
- 3 ounces pork, beef, mushrooms, and/or seafood
- 1 to 3 teaspoons gochugaru (Korean red chili pepper flakes) [JRC: 1 is enough]
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil (use a little more if using more gochugaru)
- 1 cup water or anchovy broth [JRC: use half/half, or fish stock]
- 2 to 3 tablespoons juice from kimchi
- ½ teaspoon saewujeot (salted shrimp) or salt to taste
- pinch black pepper
- 1 scallion, finely chopped
- 1 egg

## Instructions

1. Cut the meat and kimchi into small thin strips. Add the kimchi, meat, gochugaru, garlic and sesame oil to a small pot, and place it over medium heat.
1. Stir-fry until the meat is almost cooked, 3 - 4 minutes.
1. Pour in water (or broth) and the juice from the kimchi. Bring it to a boil, and continue to boil for 3 - 4 minutes. Skim off the scum.
1. Add the soft tofu in big chunks. Stir in the salted shrimp (or salt) to taste (start with 1/4 teaspoon) and black pepper. Cook for 4 -5 minutes. Add the chopped scallion just before removing the pot from the heat.
1. Crack an egg into the stew to serve while it’s still boiling hot.
