00:38:02,476 --> 00:38:04,800
YOU KNOW. THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK I AM, OK?

750
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,904
[MONALISA] I THINK NOTHING, I DON'T THINK ANYTHING.

751
00:38:06,904 --> 00:38:09,326
I JUST DON'T WANT A MAN CONTROLLING MY REMOTE CONTROL

752
00:38:09,326 --> 00:38:12,200
FROM MY TV, THAT'S ALL. I'M THE ONE WHO CHOOSES THE CHANNELS HERE.

753
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,164
COME ON, PUT ON THAT SHIRT, GO.
[SILAS] WAKE UP, MONALISA.

754
00:38:14,164 --> 00:38:17,285
IT'S EIGHT YEARS OF RELATIONSHIP, EIGHT YEARS.

755
00:38:17,285 --> 00:38:19,056
I'M TIRED OF THIS, I WANT TO MARRY YOU.

756
00:38:19,056 --> 00:38:20,328
[MONALISA] BUT, MY LOVE, IN A WINNING TEAM

757
00:38:20,328 --> 00:38:22,688
DON'T MOVE, UNDERSTAND? DON'T MOVE. COME ON, WEAR THIS ONE...

758
00:38:22,688 --> 00:38:24,951
[SILAS] WHICH TEAM IS WINNING?
[LAUGHTER] AND MY TEAM IS WINNING?

759
00:38:24,951 --> 00:38:26,165
[MONALISA] WHAT, YOU'RE NOT WINNING?
[SILAS] MY TEAM IS WINNING

760
00:38:26,165 --> 00:38:27,421
WHERE, MONALISA?
[MONALISA] WHAT'S YOUR TEAM LIKE?

761
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:28,496
SO, SILAS?
[SILAS] MY TEAM IS IN THE LAST PLACE

762
00:38:28,496 --> 00:38:30,338
A LONG TIME AGO, A LONG TIME AGO.
[MONALISA] WHAT IS THIS?

763
00:38:30,338 --> 00:38:31,840
[SILAS] LOOK HERE, I'M THE ONE WHO HAS TO COOK

764
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,199
AT HOME, I HAVE TO WASH MY UNDERWEAR,

765
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:35,607
I'M THE ONE WHO HAS TO...
[MONALISA] OH! WAIT THEN,

766
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:38,643
CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN. NOW I UNDERSTAND.

767
00:38:38,643 --> 00:38:40,556
IF YOU WANT BED, TABLE AND BATH, MY LOVE,

768
00:38:40,556 --> 00:38:43,112
HIRE A CLEANER. ARE YOU CRAZY?

769
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:45,218
OR, MY LOVE, YOU CAN ALSO MARRY A LITTLE WOMAN

770
00:38:45,218 --> 00:38:47,993
ANYWAY, GO BACK TO MOMMY'S HOUSE, BIG BABY.

771
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,120
OH! PUT ON THOSE SHOES.
[SILAS] MONALISA,

772
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,261
SOMETIMES I THINK YOU STILL LIKE TYPHOON

773
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:54,499
AND NOT FROM ME, YOU KNOW?

774
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:59,345
[MONALISA] ME, HUH!
I BELIEVE, GOD FORBID ME!

775
00:38:59,345 --> 00:39:02,185
LOOK, I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING:
THE TYPHOON IS A PAST.

776
00:39:02,185 --> 00:39:04,599
A DEAD AND BURIED PAST. AND LOOK WHAT ELSE,

777
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:05,615
ENOUGH ABOUT THIS. COME ON, LETS GO.

778
00:39:05,615 --> 00:39:07,426
[SILAS] NO. NO, THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. THE CONVERSATION IS NOT OVER, NO.

779
00:39:07,426 --> 00:39:09,538
THE CONVERSATION IS NOT OVER, WOMAN. LET'S TALK...

780
00:39:09,538 --> 00:39:11,595
IT'S NOT OVER, NO. LET'S TALK OVER COFFEE...

781
00:39:11,595 --> 00:39:13,197
[MONALISA] NOTHING OF THAT. GO, GO, GO, GO.

782
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:15,237
[SILAS] NONE OF THAT WHAT? WE'RE GOING TO HAVE BREAKFAST

783
00:39:15,237 --> 00:39:17,419
AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT.

784
00:39:17,419 --> 00:39:18,698
[IRAN] OH, NO. WAIT, MOM.

785
00:39:18,698 --> 00:39:20,435
ARE YOU GOING TO WAIT FOR ME AT THE DOOR? CALM DOWN.

786
00:39:20,435 --> 00:39:21,766
[SILAS] NO, IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU, NO, IRAN.

787
00:39:21,766 --> 00:39:23,894
THIS HOLLY GIRL IS SENDING ME AWAY AGAIN,

788
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,866
THAT'S IT. OK, I'M GOING TO GO SO... BYE... BYE.

789
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:30,123
[MONALISA] BYE... BYE. GONE. KISS.

790
00:39:30,123 --> 00:39:31,297
[DOOR CLOSE]

791
00:39:31,297 --> 00:39:33,387
[STEPS]

792
00:39:33,387 --> 00:39:35,887
[IRAN] MORNING, DEAL WITH SILAS.

793
00:39:35,887 --> 00:39:38,168
[MONALISA] OH, MY SON. MEN TREAT THEMSELVES LIKE THIS, HUH!

794
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:40,218
[IRAN] IT'S BAD, HUH? IF A WOMAN TREATS ME LIKE THIS,

795
00:39:40,218 --> 00:39:41,234
I'M NEVER COMING BACK.

796
00:39:41,234 --> 00:39:42,585
[MONALISA] MY SON, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU, MY SON?

797
00:39:42,585 --> 00:39:44,628
YOU'RE DOWN.
[IRAN] I AM.

798
00:39:44,628 --> 00:39:48,357
[MONALISA] MY SON, YOU'RE SO SKINNY, POOR THING.

799
00:39:48,357 --> 00:39:51,159
THESE WOMEN ARE SUCKING YOUR BLOOD, RIGHT? OH MY FATHER.

800
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:54,357
DO YOU WANT TO EAT SOMETHING? DO YOU WANT A SANDWICH? I'LL MAKE IT.

801
00:39:54,357 --> 00:39:55,512
[IRAN] BUT THE TRUTH IS I'M HANGOVER

802
00:39:55,512 --> 00:39:56,802
UNTIL NOW, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

803
00:39:56,802 --> 00:39:59,470
[MONALISA] SO, HOW WAS THE CAFONAS PARTY THERE?

804
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,951
[IRAN] MOTHER, YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

805
00:40:01,951 --> 00:40:05,164
WHAT A MISTAKE, MOM. JORGINHO GOT CRAZY, TOOK ALL THEM,

806
00:40:05,164 --> 00:40:06,955
HE MADE A BIG MISTAKE, HE EVEN FIGHTED WITH HIS MOTHER.

807
00:40:06,955 --> 00:40:09,359
[MONALISA] [LAUGHTER] BUT, MY SON, I UNDERSTAND,

808
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,871
WITH THAT JARARACA MOTHER HE HAS.

809
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,121
[LELECO] OH, HERE, IF YOU LEAVE THIS... THESE WOMEN WILL SIT DOWN

810
00:40:17,121 --> 00:40:19,854
ON TOP OF US, HUH. WHERE HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A FEMALE JURY?

811
00:40:19,854 --> 00:40:23,957
TO ELECT A STRAIGHT GIRL? LISTEN, TELL YOUR MOTHER,

812
00:40:23,957 --> 00:40:26,955
THAT THE JURY WILL BE COMPOSED OF MEN, REAL MEN,

813
00:40:26,955 --> 00:40:29,398
ME, DIOGENES, SILAS AND ADAUTO.

814
00:40:29,398 --> 00:40:31,340
[TYPHOON] OH FATHER, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PUT ME IN THE MIDDLE OF ANOTHER FIGHT,

815
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:35,000
NO, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? I'M PUTTING YOU AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE JURY.

816
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,422
AND ALSO, IF THE MONALISA ALLOWS YOU. NOW, YOU HAVE TO BEHAVE YOURSELVES,

817
00:40:38,422 --> 00:40:41,921
YOU HAVE TO HAVE ETHICS, YOU HAVE TO JUDGE ABOVE ALL

818
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:42,932
PERSONAL INTEREST.

819
00:40:42,932 --> 00:40:46,686
[DIOGENES] CALM DOWN, WE'RE GOING TO BE TOTALLY IMPARTIAL.

820
00:40:46,686 --> 00:40:49,719
[SILAS] AND TRANSPARENT, RIGHT. HERE. OH ADAUTO,

821
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,973
YOU WON'T SAY ANYTHING, RIGHT?

822
00:40:50,973 --> 00:40:52,464
[ADAUTO] I AM AGAINST IT, I THINK THAT THE PERSON SHOULD DO THIS

823
00:40:52,464 --> 00:40:55,010
THE JUDGMENT HERE IS MURICY AND IVANA, THAT YOU...

824
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,798
YOU'RE GOING TO... TO...

825
00:40:57,798 --> 00:40:59,006
[TOGETHER] DISTORT!

826
00:40:59,006 --> 00:41:00,694
[ADAUTO] YES, YOU'RE GOING TO MESS UP THE BUSINESS,

827
00:41:00,694 --> 00:41:02,954
AND A STRAIGHTENER GIRL IS NOT... IT'S A BEAUTY CONTEST,

828
00:41:02,954 --> 00:41:04,686
IT'S NOT A WOMAN'S "SERVE-SERVE", NO.

829
00:41:04,686 --> 00:41:07,500
[DIOGENES] "IXI"!
[LELECO] ADAUTO, ARE YOU A FAGGOT?

830
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,300
[ADAUTO] WHAT'S THIS, LELECO?
[DIOGENES] OH, POOR BOY.

831
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,920
[SILAS] HEY, HEY, STOP, STOP, STOP! HEY GUYS, LET'S KEEP IT GOING

832
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,552
THE LEVEL. LET'S KEEP THE LEVEL OF THIS HERE, BOY. LOOK HERE,

833
00:41:16,552 --> 00:41:20,021
OH, PROVOLONE, A SKEWER HERE, ON THE HOUSE.

834
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:24,718
[TYPHOON] HEY, HEY, VALENTINE! BRING ME ONE OF THOSE CHICKEN WINGS

835
00:41:24,718 --> 00:41:26,558
OR IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK OF YOU?

836
00:41:26,558 --> 00:41:28,623
[SILAS] OH, VALENTIM, CAN'T YOU HEAR THE TYPHOON, BOY?

837
00:41:28,623 --> 00:41:30,589
[VALENTIM] OF COURSE I HEARD IT, RIGHT, SILAS. CHAMPION HERE

838
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:32,913
DON'T ASK, THE CHAMPION IS IN CHARGE. THAT'S WHY I'M GOING.

839
00:41:32,913 --> 00:41:34,217
[DIOGENES] HEY!

840
00:41:34,217 --> 00:41:37,758
[SILAS] ADAUTO, COME HERE, ADAUTO. DON'T GET INTO THIS

841
00:41:37,758 --> 00:41:39,392
NO PIRA, ADULTO.
[CARMINHA] AND YOUR HUSBAND, IVANA?

842
00:41:39,392 --> 00:41:42,846
[IVANA] HE WENT TO THE COMPANY EARLY... OW! I HAVE TO GO,

843
00:41:42,846 --> 00:41:45,801
I'M LATE. HE'S TAKING CARE OF THE MARKETING CAMPAIGN

844
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:47,495
FROM OUR STRAIGHTENER GIRL CONTEST.

845
00:41:47,495 --> 00:41:49,630
[MURICY] OH! WAIT, WAIT, IVANA! OH, IVANA,

846
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,090
I HAVE SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

847
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,233
[IVANA] OK, KEEP TALKING.
[MURICY] IVANA,

848
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:53,593
FOR GOD'S SAKE!
[IVANA] SPEAK, SPEAK.

849
00:41:53,593 --> 00:41:55,716
[MURICY] IVANA, LISTEN, MY DAUGHTER. YOU ARE A PERSON WHO

850
00:41:55,716 --> 00:41:58,300
YOU HAVE AN ACTIVE VOICE WITHIN THAT FIRM OF OUR, RIGHT, DEAR?

851
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,024
[IVANA] OF COURSE.
[MURICY] AND THE FIRM IS A FIRM

852
00:42:00,024 --> 00:42:02,007
FAMILY. IS IT OR ISN'T IT, CARMINHA?

853
00:42:02,007 --> 00:42:03,050
[CARMINHA] MORE OR LESS.

854
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:04,509
[MURICY] AH, MORE OR LESS, SHE'S JEALOUS...

855
00:42:04,509 --> 00:42:05,832
[CARMINHA] MY COFFEE, ZEZÉ!

856
00:42:05,832 --> 00:42:08,073
[MURICY] IT SO HAPPENS THAT I HEARD THAT LELECO WANTS

857
00:42:08,073 --> 00:42:11,965
BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE JURY OF THE CHAPINHA GIRL! AND WANT TO TAKE IT

858
00:42:11,965 --> 00:42:14,355
THOSE FRIENDS ALL THERE BAR ALL TO BE JURY TOGETHER

859
00:42:14,355 --> 00:42:18,178
WITH HIM. PEOPLE, DON'T YOU THINK IT'S ANYTHING WORTH IT? FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,

860
00:42:18,178 --> 00:42:21,354
PEOPLE, THIS DOESN'T LOOK WELL! THIS DOESN'T LOOK WELL FOR OUR FAMILY,

861
00:42:21,354 --> 00:42:24,536
FOR OUR FIRM, THAT BUNCH OF GUYS JUDGING THAT MOUNTAIN

862
00:42:24,536 --> 00:42:27,694
OF A HOT WOMAN! WHAT IS THIS? I THINK THAT IT IS JUST, DIGNIFIED,

863
00:42:27,694 --> 00:42:31,782
I WOULD LIKE TO BE THE JURY PRESIDENT, RIGHT?

864
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:34,809
[IVANA] THAT'S RIGHT, MOM. I'M GOING TO LAUNCH YOUR CANDIDACY,

865
00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:36,933
BUT MONALISA WILL HAVE TO APPROVE, RIGHT?

866
00:42:36,933 --> 00:42:38,067
[MURICY] WHY DOES MONALISA HAVE TO APPROVE?

867
00:42:38,067 --> 00:42:40,245
[IVANA] WELL, BECAUSE SHE OWNS HALF THE COMPANY, MOM.

868
00:42:40,245 --> 00:42:42,161
BY THE WAY, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF THIS JURY EITHER,

869
00:42:42,161 --> 00:42:43,226
NO, CARMINHA?
[CARMINHA] NO, THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

870
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:45,077
I WILL PASS. IF I CAN AVOID ANY CONTACT FROM ME

871
00:42:45,077 --> 00:42:47,170
AND MY FAMILY WITH THAT AMORAL LITTLE WOMAN,

872
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,055
SO MUCH BETTER.
[IVANA] OH, HONESTLY,

873
00:42:49,055 --> 00:42:52,039
CARMINHA, I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE SO MUCH ANNOYED ABOUT MONALISA.

874
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:53,313
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? WHAT DID SHE DO WRONG?

875
00:42:53,313 --> 00:42:55,545
[CARMINHA] WHAT DID SHE DO WRONG? THAT WOMAN

876
00:42:55,545 --> 00:42:57,918
IS A CANCER IN OUR COMMUNITY. A WOMAN WHO CARRIES

877
00:42:57,918 --> 00:43:01,080
A WASTED LIFE, SINGLE MOTHER, CONCUBINA.

878
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,983
SHE HAS BEEN LIVING WITH THAT MAN FOR YEARS.

879
00:43:02,983 --> 00:43:05,852
[IVANA] SHE'S DATING SILAS! SHE DOESN'T WANT TO MARRY HIM,

880
00:43:05,852 --> 00:43:07,525
SHE'S HAPPY LIKE THIS. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

881
00:43:07,525 --> 00:43:10,245
[CARMINHA] IVANA, PLEASE, HUH. IT'S VERY MODERN.

882
00:43:10,245 --> 00:43:12,706
I REALLY ADMIRE YOU, A FAMILY WOMAN SPEAKING LIKE THIS!

883
00:43:12,706 --> 00:43:14,825
[MURICY] DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS, THIS IS ALREADY INFLUENCE

884
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,278
FROM THAT MESSALINA, DID YOU KNOW?

885
00:43:16,278 --> 00:43:17,885
[IVANA] LOOK HERE, I'M GOING TO WORK, I HAVE

886
00:43:17,885 --> 00:43:20,088
MORE TO DO. YOU CAN SPEND THE WHOLE DAY THERE TALKING

887
00:43:20,088 --> 00:43:21,985
OF OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES, OK?
[MURICY] WAIT AREA. OH IVANA,

888
00:43:21,985 --> 00:43:23,800
IVANA. IVANA! IVANA!

889
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,774
[IVANA] YOU WILL BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE JURY.

890
00:43:25,774 --> 00:43:27,139
[M URICY] BUT IT'S ONE THING... LOOK, DID YOU SEE HOW IT IS?

891
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:29,241
