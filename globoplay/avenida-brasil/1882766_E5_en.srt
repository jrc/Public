PAY ATTENTION. LOOK. THE SON IS OURS

603
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:22,090
AND I GIVE HIM WHATEVER I WANT, UNDERSTAND?

604
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:25,362
[ALEXIA] HOLY SHIT, LIFE REALLY IS A SURPRISE, ISN'T IT?

605
00:33:25,362 --> 00:33:29,250

00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:42,898
[ALEXIA] YOU HAVE NO FAMILY!

612
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:44,122

GIVE ME THIS FUTON HERE. WHAT'S FUTON?

615
00:33:48,418 --> 00:33:51,139
I DON'T WANT A FUTON. STOP IT... STOP IT... OW!

[ALEXIA] WHAT'S UP, CRUCIBLE?

THAT'S CRAZY, I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME PROPERLY.

634
00:35:01,902 --> 00:35:05,375
[CRUCIBLE] LOOK, IT'S CARLOS EDUARDO DE SOUZA QUEIROZ,

I AM 35 YEARS OLD, 5'11" TALL,
78 KILOS, BRAZILIAN, FAN

636
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:13,060

637
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,099
[ALEXIA] MARITAL STATUS?

638
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:15,250
[CRUCIBLE] SINGLE.

639
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,413
[ALEXIA] CONVINCED?

640
00:35:16,413 --> 00:35:20,869
[CADINHO] I'VE BEEN, BUT I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO.

641
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,516
[ALEXIA] WHY?

642
00:35:22,516 --> 00:35:26,354
[CADINHO] BECAUSE I MET AN INCREDIBLE WOMAN, THE WOMAN

643
00:35:26,354 --> 00:35:28,164
MOST WONDERFUL I HAVE EVER MET IN MY LIFE.

644
00:35:30,686 --> 00:35:32,617
[ALEXIA] YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

645
00:35:32,617 --> 00:35:35,367
[CADINHO] NOT YET, UNLESS, OF COURSE, SHE ACCEPTS

646
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:36,499
MY PROPOSAL.

647
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:41,148
HE WANTS?

648
00:35:41,148 --> 00:35:43,785
BE MY GIRLFRIEND? HUH?

649
00:35:43,785 --> 00:35:49,122
[ALEXIA] OH CADINHO, MY LOVE, I PROMISE I WILL THINK ABOUT IT

650
00:35:49,122 --> 00:35:52,571
WITH LOVE IN YOUR PROPOSAL, OK? I PROMISE.

651
00:35:52,571 --> 00:35:56,477
[CADINHO] ARE YOU REALLY GOING? THINK ABOUT IT CAREFULLY, OK? BECAUSE...

652
00:35:56,477 --> 00:35:59,875
I'VE NEVER FELT THIS FOR ANYONE.

653
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:02,330
[ALEXIA] MY LOVE, NOW GO FOR IT, OK?

654
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
[CARMINHA] NO, AUNT, I'M NOT INTERESTED

655
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
IN NO PRODUCT, NO.

656
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,479
[MURICY] NO, NO, WAIT, I'M NOT SELLING ANYTHING,

657
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:09,125
I AM THE MOTHER OF THE TYPHOON.

658
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:12,162
[CARMINHA] MRS. MURICY?

659
00:36:12,162 --> 00:36:15,683
[MURICY] IS IT [LAUGHTER] DID I ARRIVE AT A BAD TIME? AM I BOTHERING YOU HERE?

660
00:36:15,683 --> 00:36:17,502
[CARMINHA] NO, NOT AT ALL.

661
00:36:17,502 --> 00:36:20,226
[MURICY] HERE, I BROUGHT YOU THIS PAPAYA SWEET, THIS

662
00:36:20,226 --> 00:36:22,582
THIS IS MY SPECIALTY, I MAKE IT. LET ME PUT IT IN

663
00:36:22,582 --> 00:36:25,500
IN THE FRIDGE, MY DAUGHTER. EVERYONE LOVES THIS SWEET

664
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,921
AT HOME, MY DAUGHTER.

665
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:29,859
[CARMINHA] OH, I LOVE PAPAYA JAM.

666
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:32,641
[MURICY] WOW, YOU KNOW I REMEMBER YOU PERFECTLY

667
00:36:32,641 --> 00:36:35,968
IN THAT AD. THAT AD WAS FOR... OIL.

668
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,469
TANNING, ISN'T IT? [LAUGHTER]

669
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:41,685
THERE WAS A HUGE BILLBOARD IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE, GIRL.

670
00:36:41,685 --> 00:36:43,799
[CARMINHA] WOW, BUT DO YOU REMEMBER? IT'S BEEN SO LONG.

671
00:36:43,799 --> 00:36:45,706
[MURICY] BUT JUST BY LOOKING AT YOU I CAN ALREADY TELL

672
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:48,814
THAT YOU ARE A PERSON, SO, WELL-TRAVELLED, A PERSON OF CLASS.

673
00:36:48,814 --> 00:36:50,602
LOOK AT THIS NICE WAY YOU GAVE TO THIS APARTMENT,

674
00:36:50,602 --> 00:36:51,809
GIRL.

675
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,474
[CARMINHA] OH, IMAGINE, DONA MURICY, YOUR SON WAS THE ONE WHO WAS

676
00:36:53,474 --> 00:36:56,135
VERY GENEROUS TO LET ME STAY HERE FOR THIS LONG, I WHO

677
00:36:56,135 --> 00:36:58,682
I DON'T FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE, YOU KNOW? BUT I'M ALREADY LOOKING FOR IT

678
00:36:58,682 --> 00:36:59,909
A PLACE TO GO.

679
00:36:59,909 --> 00:37:02,151
[MURICY] NO WAY, MY DAUGHTER, YOU'RE GOING TO STAY HERE

680
00:37:02,151 --> 00:37:05,175
AS LONG AS YOU WANT. THIS WOULD BE BETTER HERE.

681
00:37:05,175 --> 00:37:07,608
IMAGINE, MY FAMILY, MY FAMILY HAS A DEBT

682
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:11,439
WITH YOU, MY DEAR, YOU... YOU COULD HAVE GIVEN PART OF THE

683
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:15,054
MY SON WHEN HE RUN OVER YOUR HUSBAND, BUT YOU DIDN'T GIVE IT!

684
00:37:15,054 --> 00:37:17,347
[CARMINHA] NO, BUT THE TYPHOON WASN'T TO BLAME, NO, GENÉSIO WAS

685
00:37:17,347 --> 00:37:19,832
IT'S THAT YOUR SON THREW HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE CAR, EVEN

686
00:37:19,832 --> 00:37:20,889
CALLED THE AMBULANCE.

687
00:37:20,889 --> 00:37:21,956
[MURICY] BUT I KNOW, MY DAUGHTER, BUT IF YOU WERE NOT

688
00:37:21,956 --> 00:37:24,681
THIS PERSON OF CHARACTER, THIS PERSON OF INTEGRITY THAT YOU ARE,

689
00:37:24,681 --> 00:37:27,000
YOU COULD HAVE USED THIS FOR EVIL, TO BLACKMAIL,

690
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,142
THESE THINGS, RIGHT?

691
00:37:28,142 --> 00:37:29,843
[CARMINHA] WOW, I WOULD NEVER DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

692
00:37:29,843 --> 00:37:32,333
[MURICY] I KNOW, I KNOW YOU DON'T, I ALREADY LIKED YOU THERE

693
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:36,081
BEFORE, NOW THAT I KNOW YOU, I LIKE YOU EVEN MORE.

694
00:37:36,081 --> 00:37:39,600
I WILL TAKE THE LIBERTY OF SAYING ONE THING TO YOU, MY DAUGHTER.

695
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,760
[CARMINHA] YOU CAN SAY.

696
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,478
[MURICY] I KNOW YOU'RE GOING THROUGH A MOMENT

697
00:37:42,478 --> 00:37:46,016
VERY DIFFICULT. WHAT'S THERE? IT'S BEEN A LITTLE OVER A MONTH, RIGHT?

698
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:47,932
THAT YOU LOST YOUR HUSBAND IN SUCH A STUPID WAY,

699
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,842
SO BRUTAL, ISN'T IT?

700
00:37:49,842 --> 00:37:51,712
[CARMINHA] THE PAIN ONLY GETS WORSE, DONA MURICY.

701
00:37:51,712 --> 00:37:56,799
[MURICY] I IMAGINE, DEAR, I IMAGINE, BUT LOOK, LIFE...

702
00:37:56,799 --> 00:38:00,520
LIFE IS A THING... IT'S A VERY CRAZY THING, IT TAKES YOU AWAY

703
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,551
ONE THING ABOUT US, SHE RETURNS ANOTHER IN ITS PLACE.

704
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:07,187
IT'S TRUE, MY DAUGHTER, LOOK AT YOUR CASE, FOR EXAMPLE, ISN'T IT?

705
00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:10,194
GOD TOOK AWAY YOUR HUSBAND, BUT HE PUT MY SON IN YOURS

706
00:38:10,194 --> 00:38:13,392
WAY. GOD IS CRAZY, MY DAUGHTER, GOD IS CRAZY, HE WRITES

707
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:14,870
RIGHT IN CROOKED LINES!

708
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,125
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

709
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:20,962
[CARMINHA] OF COURSE, YOU CAN, YOU CAN.

710
00:38:20,962 --> 00:38:23,370
[MURICY] YOU, LIKE THIS...

711
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:26,314
DO YOU HAVE ANY FEELINGS FOR MY SON?

712
00:38:26,314 --> 00:38:28,991
[CARMINHA] OH, MRS. MURICY...

713
00:38:28,991 --> 00:38:31,838
IT IS DIFFICULT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, LIKE THIS, AT THIS TIME.

714
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:37,134
IMAGINE, IF IT WERE IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES, I WOULD SAY THAT...

715
00:38:37,134 --> 00:38:38,315
YES.

716
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:41,645
[MURICY] I KNEW! THE TYPHOON DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING, NOTHING, BUT LOOK,

717
00:38:41,645 --> 00:38:44,099
I KNOW THAT BOY, HE FEELS SOMETHING TOO

718
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:45,328
THING FOR YOU.

719
00:38:45,328 --> 00:38:47,452
[CARMINHA] OH, DONA MURICY, PLEASE, DON'T SAY A THING

720
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:49,955
NOT THOSE, MY HEAD IS VERY CONFUSED, IMAGINE,

721
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:52,521
I CAN'T, I CAN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT ANYTHING.

722
00:38:52,521 --> 00:38:54,736
[MURICY] NO, OF COURSE, IMAGINE, LET'S GIVE TIME TO TIME, RIGHT?

723
00:38:54,736 --> 00:38:56,669
DAUGHTER? LET'S LET THINGS TAKE THEIR COURSE, RIGHT? BUT I

724
00:38:56,669 --> 00:39:00,214
I ALSO WANTED TO INVITE YOU, WE HAVE A HOUSE

725
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:02,636
FROM THE BEACH, YOU KNOW? OVER IN CABO FRIO. THE HOUSE, LIKE, IS NOT THOSE

726
00:39:02,636 --> 00:39:05,420
GREAT LUXURIES, NO, YOU KNOW? BUT IT'S FACING THE SEA,

727
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,740
THERE'S NOTHING BETTER TO, YOU KNOW, COOL YOUR HEAD.

728
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,872
[CARMINHA] AH, IMAGINE, I CAN'T ACCEPT IT...

729
00:39:10,872 --> 00:39:13,678
[MURICY] OF COURSE YOU CAN, YOU MUST ACCEPT. IMAGINE, MY DAUGHTER,

730
00:39:13,678 --> 00:39:17,734
WHAT'S THIS? LOOK, HERE'S THE KEY TO THE HOUSE AND THE ADDRESS IS HERE

731
00:39:17,734 --> 00:39:23,093
INSIDE, OK? AND LOOK, I DON'T ACCEPT "NO" FOR AN ANSWER.

732
00:39:23,093 --> 00:39:25,204
[CARMINHA] OH, BUT, DONA MURICY, NO...

733
00:39:25,204 --> 00:39:27,062
[MURICY] IT WILL DO YOU GOOD.

734
00:39:29,091 --> 00:39:31,415
[MURICY] WHO KNOWS MY SON WON'T COME THERE TO MAKE YOU DO IT

735
00:39:31,415 --> 00:39:33,340
A LITTLE VISIT, HUM?

736
00:39:35,744 --> 00:39:36,797
[MURICY] I'M GOING.

737
00:39:36,797 --> 00:39:37,993
I WON'T TAKE UP ANY MORE OF YOUR TIME, DEAR.

738
00:39:37,993 --> 00:39:39,760
[CARMINHA] DONA MURICY, WHAT'S THIS? BUT ARE YOU SURE?

739
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,485
DON'T YOU WANT TO STAY A LITTLE LONGER? SHALL I MAKE YOU SOME COFFEE?

740
00:39:41,485 --> 00:39:43,772
[MURICY] NO, ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER DAY, NOW YOU GO THERE

741
00:39:43,772 --> 00:39:47,186
INSIDE, ARE YOU GOING TO PACK YOUR BAGS AND GO TO CABO FRIO, HUH? [LAUGHTER]

742
00:39:47,186 --> 00:39:48,314
LOOK, DEAR...

743
00:39:48,314 --> 00:39:49,390
[CARMINHA] I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

744
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:52,704
[MURICY] YOU DON'T SAY ANYTHING. IT WAS A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU,

745
00:39:52,704 --> 00:39:53,999
CAN I SAY ONE THING?

746
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:55,120
