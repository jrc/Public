[CARMINHA] WERE YOU JEALOUS OF GENÉSIO? DID NOT HAVE.

920
00:54:37,999 --> 00:54:39,632
SO, MY LOVE, SAME THING. [MAX] NO, IT'S NOT THE SAME THING,

921
00:54:39,632 --> 00:54:41,835
NO, MA'AM, IT'S DIFFERENT. GENÉSIO WAS A CROWN,

922
00:54:41,835 --> 00:54:44,095
THIS GUY IS A BIG BOY, ALMOST MY AGE, UNDERSTAND?

923
00:54:44,095 --> 00:54:47,819
FOOTBALL PLAYER, RICH, FULL OF... LOOK, WE DIDN'T HAVE

924
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:50,936
ARRANGEMENT THAT WE GO TO SÃO PAULO, TO START A NEW LIFE,

925
00:54:50,936 --> 00:54:53,631
AS SOON AS WE COULD GET SOME MONEY? READY.

926
00:54:53,631 --> 00:54:57,113
WE HAVE ALREADY GOT THE MONEY, WE ALREADY HAVE EVERYTHING RIGHT.

927
00:54:57,113 --> 00:54:59,092
NOW, WE MADE THIS SUCK, SHALL WE GET OUT?

928
00:54:59,092 --> 00:55:00,966
[CARMINHA] WHAT A LOT? ONLY IF IT'S FOR YOU, MAX!

929
00:55:00,966 --> 00:55:04,325
MIXURUCADA, FOR ME IT IS MIXURUCADA. THINK BIG.

930
00:55:04,325 --> 00:55:08,253
TAKE A LOOK, TYPHOON, FOOTBALL STAR, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS,

931
00:55:08,253 --> 00:55:09,790
PAINTED BIG FISH IN THE AREA.

932
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:11,912
[MAX] YOU'RE COMPLETELY CRAZY, YOU'RE FREAKING OUT,

933
00:55:11,912 --> 00:55:14,411
YOU ARE CRAZY, DELIRIOUS, UNDERSTAND?

934
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:17,486
AND THEN, WHO GUARANTEES YOU THAT THIS GUY IS GOING TO MISS YOU?

935
00:55:17,486 --> 00:55:19,441
HE TELLS ME. [CARMINHA] I UNDERSTAND MEN,

936
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:23,249
YOU KNOW THAT. I SAW IT IN HIS EYE

937
00:55:23,249 --> 00:55:26,704
THAT HE IS NEEDY, UNSAFE,

938
00:55:26,704 --> 00:55:29,930
IT'S PURE THE POOR THING...

939
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:31,556
IT'S GUILTY.

940
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:36,606
[CARMINHO] THAT'S IT, HE'S GUILTY,

941
00:55:36,606 --> 00:55:38,462
AND THAT'S WHERE I CREATE MYSELF.

942
00:55:38,462 --> 00:55:40,712
[MAX] LET ME JUST TELL YOU A QUICK QUICK:

943
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:43,597
WITH THESE 50 DICKS WE CAN JOIN SOCIETY

944
00:55:43,597 --> 00:55:45,684
WITH THAT FRIEND OF MINE, THAT BROTHER I TOLD YOU ABOUT

945
00:55:45,684 --> 00:55:47,565
AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE A COOL STOP.

946
00:55:47,565 --> 00:55:49,306
[CARMINHA] SHUT UP, SHUT UP, MAX, SHUT UP.

947
00:55:49,306 --> 00:55:54,760
HELP ME THINK HERE. WHY IS THIS TYPHOON SO GUILTY?

948
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,386
HE SAID THAT HE OWED GENESIO SOME MONEY, THAT GENESIO

949
00:55:57,386 --> 00:55:59,900
IT HELPED HIM AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER, GENÉSIO NEVER TOLD ME

950
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:03,131
NONE OF THAT. AFTER, HE DIDN'T KNOW RIGHT WHERE IT WAS

951
00:56:03,131 --> 00:56:06,127
THIS HOUSE HERE ON THE STREET. THEN I CAUGHT HIM IN A LYING

952
00:56:06,127 --> 00:56:08,575
WHEN I COMMENTED THAT THE NAME OF THE FIRST WOMAN IN GENESIO

953
00:56:08,575 --> 00:56:13,083
IT WAS HELENA, HE CONFIRMED. THE DECEASED CALLED MARTA.

954
00:56:15,411 --> 00:56:18,133
[CARMINHA] THIS GUY DOESN'T KNOW WHO GENESIO IS.

955
00:56:18,133 --> 00:56:23,167
THIS GUY NEVER MET GENÉSIO.

956
00:56:23,167 --> 00:56:26,144
THEN WHY DID HE APPEAR AT THE CEMETERY?

957
00:56:26,144 --> 00:56:28,664
WHY DOES HE WANT TO HELP ME SO MUCH?

958
00:56:28,664 --> 00:56:31,755
[MAX] I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW, YOU'LL SEE...

959
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:35,030
GO SEE THIS TYPHOON ALSO GAVE A... A BLOW ON THE SUCKER

960
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:39,062
FROM GENÉSIO, THEN TYPHOON GOT RICH, GENÉSIO DIED,

961
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,282
THE BLAME... I DON'T KNOW, LET'S STOP TALKING ABOUT THIS GUY,

962
00:56:41,282 --> 00:56:43,636
I'M STARVING, I WANT TO DRINK A BEER

963
00:56:43,636 --> 00:56:47,347
AND LET'S DO IT... [CARMINHA] I KNOW! I ALREADY KNOW!

964
00:56:47,347 --> 00:56:51,566
OH MY GOD, HOW DID I NOT THINK OF THIS BEFORE?

965
00:56:51,566 --> 00:56:53,216
IT WAS THE TYPHOON THAT RUN OVER GENESIO!
