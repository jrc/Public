For a crisp crust and a juicy interior, the secret is starting your salmon in a cold skillet.

## Ingredients

- Kosher salt and pepper
- 4 (6- to 8-ounce), skin-on salmon fillets
- Lemon wedges

## Instructions

1. Dissolve 1/2 cup salt in 2 quarts water in large
   container. Submerge salmon in brine and let stand at
   room temperature for 15 minutes. Remove salmon
   from brine and pat dry with paper towels.
1. Sprinkle bottom of 12-inch nonstick skillet
   evenly with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
   Place fillets, skin side down, in skillet and sprinkle
   tops of fillets with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon
   pepper. Heat skillet over medium-high heat and
   cook fillets without moving them until fat begins to
   render, skin begins to brown, and bottom 1/4 inch
   of fillets turns opaque, 6 to 8 minutes.
1. Using tongs, flip fillets and continue to cook
   without moving them until centers are still translucent
   when checked with tip of paring knife and
   register 125 degrees, 6 to 8 minutes longer. Transfer
   fillets skin side down to serving platter and let rest
   for 5 minutes before serving with lemon wedges.
